# POCRE
Proof Of co-CREation

For remixes, [mashups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(culture)) & collaborative work, copyright is impossible. Authors/publishers don't recognize co-creations and new artists risk legal action.
Managing copyright is a challenge in the digital world, as there is not a perfect solution for emerging artists who rely on existing works and therefore can never claim the opera as original and get rewards.
There continues to be a problematic identification process of who retains authorship, and copyright, surrounding music and digital media that deploys the use of existing works. 

### POCRE solves the authorship acknowledgement of materials created by multiple authors, via a novel identification process based on Cardano [HYDRA](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/). 

By connecting various parties through [Cardano](https://cardano.org) blockchain, parties are able to interact through smart contract workflows that allows for complete transparency in the ownership, authorship, and copyright processes:
- 1st Creator: Autonomous authorship management
- Co-Creator: Invited to authorship acknowledgement
- Claimer: Claim authorship acknowledgement
- Litigator: Resolving disputes

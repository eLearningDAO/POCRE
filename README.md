# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Proof Of co-CREation
#

For remixes, [mashups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(culture)) & collaborative work, copyright is impossible. Authors/publishers don't recognize co-creations and new artists risk legal action.
Managing copyright is a challenge in the digital world, as there is not a perfect solution for emerging artists who rely on existing works and therefore can never claim the opera as original and get rewards.
There continues to be a problematic identification process of who retains authorship, and copyright, surrounding music and digital media that deploys the use of existing works. 

### POCRE solves the authorship acknowledgement of materials created by multiple authors, via a novel identification process based on Cardano [HYDRA](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/). 

By connecting various parties through [Cardano](https://cardano.org) blockchain, parties are able to interact through smart contract workflows that allows for complete transparency in the ownership, authorship, and copyright processes:
- 1st Creator: Autonomous authorship management
- Co-Creator: Invited to authorship acknowledgement
- Claimer: Claim authorship acknowledgement
- Litigator: Resolving disputes
